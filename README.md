Concert pianist turned Junior Developer, I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy May 2020. Inquisitive to all things tech and music, I pride myself in attention to detail and my desire to explore new technologies. I strive to build a career in Software Development, where I am challenged daily with strategical thinking at the forefront of the evolving technological world.


## Skills

#### Efficient and Economical
The attention to detail required to perform the thousands of notes in a Beethoven sonata from memory and under pressure has taught me one valuable skill - working methodically. Transferring this skill to programming has played a vital role in my efficiency when it comes to writing complex code; where incorporating strategies such as Test Driven Development or analytical thinking is essential in order to write scalable and structurally secure code.

#### Creative and Inquisitive
My love for analytical thinking and problem solving is what made programming appealing to me. I am a logical thinker and fast learner, an attribute that has been well tested during my time at Makers, and I'm always eager to try new techniques to improve my ability. My prior experience as a musician has taught me to be inquisitive and to try many solutions, as it broadens ones creative scope and encourages an educated output.

#### Communication

During my time at Makers, I was tasked with programming in pairs or teams nearly every day of the course. Communication is crucial to continuous learning as well as being able to summarise problems to find efficient solutions. I am confident in explaining technological concepts with metaphors and non-technical language in order to make it as accessible as possible.

- Cooking! Working with different ingredients from around the world is definitely an expensive hobby to have. I have always been inspired by the food discovered when travelling throughout the world, and I love re-creating it at home for my family and friends.
- Photography. I have always been a keen photographer. As a child, I used to make stop-motion lego movies and put them on YouTube. My claim to fame was a headshot that I took which made it on the front cover of the quarterly Southbank Centre magazine in January 2019!
- Learning Spanish. Slowly but surely I am working my way through the ranks of Duolingo to improve my Spanish and be able able to order some tapas and a ca√±a in Spain on my holidays.
