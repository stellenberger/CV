## Stephan Ellenberger

Aspiring to be a developer, I am a former Classical Pianist, performing and teaching around London in prestigious venues. I rekindled a lifelong interest in technology after developing a website for students to find Professional Music Teachers around London. During this time, I started coding HTML CSS and JavaScript as a hobby, and soon decided to pursue a career in Software Development. As I write this, my journey at Makers Academy has just begun!

I strive to build a career in Software Development, where I am challenged daily with strategical thinking at the forefront of the evolving technology world.

## Skills

1. Efficient
The attention to detail required to perform the thousands of notes in a Beethoven sonata from memory has taught me one valuable skill - working methodically. I find transferring this skill to programming plays a vital role in increasing efficiency and scalability when it comes to writing complex code; where incorporating strategies such as Test Driven Development or analytically thinking in order to write structurally secure code.

2. Creative and Inquisitive
I am always eager to try new techniques and to improve my ability. I've found that I learn best by being inquisitive; going the extra mile to find out how something works in a holistic sense broadens ones creative scope and encourages an educated output.

3. Communication
Being a coherent communicator is valuable quality to have as both a leader and a member of a team. During my time as a Musician and Teacher, I liaised with organisers, fellow musicians and students on a daily basis.  I was complimented on my communication and personable approach when faced with a problem or task.  Through this I developed very good rapport with clients, colleagues and students alike.
