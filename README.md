Concert pianist turned Junior Developer, I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy May 2020. I invested myself wholly into building a career in Software Development after starting an online tutoring business in 2019, where I was fascinated by the process of creating digital products and automating payments and bookings. This, coupled with my love for problem-solving led me to pursue a career in technology, and I strive to build a career where automation, strategical thinking and working with cutting edge technologies are part of my daily life. 

I am currently volunteering my skills at non-profit now-u, leading the Front End Development team and am in the process of writing tests throughout the application.


## Skills

#### Efficient 
The attention to detail required to perform the thousands of notes in a Beethoven sonata from memory and under pressure has taught me one valuable skill - working methodically. Transferring this skill to programming has played a vital role in my efficiency when it comes to writing complex code; where incorporating strategies such as Test Driven Development or analytical thinking is essential in order to write scalable and structurally secure code. 

#### Creative and Inquisitive
My love for analytical thinking and problem solving is what made programming appealing to me. I am a logical thinker and fast learner, an attribute that has been well tested during my time at Makers and since graduating. My prior experience as a musician has taught me to be inquisitive and to try many solutions, as it broadens one's creative scope and encourages an educated output.

#### Communication

During my time at Makers, I was tasked with programming in pairs or teams every day of the course. I now lead the Front End Development team at now-u, communicating with developers from all over the world daily. I am confident in explaining technological concepts with metaphors and non-technical language in order to make it as accessible as possible.
