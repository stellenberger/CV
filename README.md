Concert pianist turned Junior Developer, I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy, cohort of May 2020. Inquisitive to all things tech and music, I pride myself in attention to detail and my desire to explore new technologies. I strive to build a career in Software Development, where I am challenged daily with strategical thinking at the forefront of the evolving technological world.


## Skills

#### Efficient and Economical
The attention to detail required to perform the thousands of notes in a Beethoven sonata from memory has taught me one valuable skill - working methodically. I find transferring this skill to programming plays a vital role in increasing efficiency and scalability when it comes to writing complex code; where incorporating strategies such as Test Driven Development or analytical thinking is essential in order to write scalable and structurally secure code.

#### Creative and Inquisitive
I am a fast learner and always eager to try new techniques and to improve my ability. I've found that I learn best by being inquisitive; going the extra mile to find out how something works in a holistic sense broadens ones creative scope and encourages an educated output. 

#### Communication

Being a coherent communicator is an essential quality to have as both a leader and a member of a team. During both my time as a musician and at Makers Academy, I liased with concert organisers, fellow musicians and programmers alike, and firmly believe that communication can make or break a project. During my time at Makers, I was tasked with programming in pairs or teams nearly every day of the course.
